# grid-geom-util
A utility library of geometric primitives. Made 2D-gridâ€“based games in mind, such as roguelikes.

I'm using this on personal projects, but I'll hopefully make it good enough for general use someday. Feel free to use it any way you want.

There isn't any crates.io crate released yet, or any versioning. This library is still under heavy development and may change a lot. I'll try to publish it properly once I feel it's mature enough.

## Usage
The main types of this library are the primitives `Point`, `Line`, and `Rect`. All types can be converted to and from tuples and arrays with the standard `Into` and `From` traits.

`Point` and `Line` are simple point and line-segment 2D primitives.
`Line` consists of a start position x1 and y1, and an end position x2 and y2.

There is a struct for circles, `Circle`, but that is still WIP and rather broken. Fixing it is a TODO.

### Rect
`Rect` is an axis-aligned rectangle consisting of a minimum-coordinate position x1 and y1, and a maximum-coordinate position x2 and y2. These are *inclusive*, meaning that if they're the same then it's a rectangle with the size 1x1, not 0x0.

This is taken into account by the `width` and `height` methods, which return `x2-x1+1` and `y2-y1+1` respectively. If you want the difference in coordinates, ie. just `x2-x1` or `y2-y1`, use the `diff_x` or `diff_y` method.

Methods of `Rect` also assume that the maximum-coordinates are greater or equal to the minimum coordinates. If this condition is broken then any method may panic, return nonsense results, or do something else undefined.

To avoid this, `Rect` is marked as `#[non_exhaustive]` to stop anyone to create them manually (like so: `Rect { x1, y1, x2, y2 }`) and the only way to create a possibly malformed rectangle is with the unsafe `new_unchecked` constructor, or by directly modifying the fields from code.


### Type Parameters
All types are generic over the choice of the coordinate type.

Most of the methods however expect them to implement the std traits `Clone` and `PartialOrd`, and the `num-traits` trait `Num`.

Many methods of the primitives don't really make much sense with non-integer coordinates (as this is meant for grid-based applications), so you should only use them only for occasions like with conversions or such.

### Display
All types implement the standard library trait `Display`. All implementations simply return the coordinate-values delimited by a comma and space, eg. `"1, 5"` or `"2, 3, 5, 5"`.

### (De)serialization
All the types implement Serde (de)serializations. For maximum portability and simplicity, they all serialize into and deserialize from regular arrays, ie. `Point<T>` becomes `[T; 2]`, `Line<T>` and `Rect<T>` become `[T; 4]`.

When deserializing into `Rect<T>` the `T` has to be `PartialOrd` in order to make sure it can't be a malformed rectangle.
